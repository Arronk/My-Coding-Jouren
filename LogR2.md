## Day 1: 19.07.2018

### Progress: Started work on Pset 4 Whodunit for CS50

Went out for dinner and a bit of fun at the casino tonight so it's a very late night boozy 1hr of coding.
Really want to get pset4 & 5 done over the next 5 days before I got on holiday so I can get onto python which
I think is going to be a much more practical language to learn that is relevant to current business.

## Day 2: 20.07.2018

### Progress: Continued with Whodunit for CS50

Trying to get my head around the header info files in Whodunit. Struggling a bit with understanding 
the numbers as nothing seems to line up. I'm sure it will click over the weekend though.

## Day 3: 21.07.2018

### Progress: Completed Whodunit but I still need to submit in the morning

Once i'd wrapped my head around it properly it was just a few lines of code to deal with. Will submit in the morning once I 
get some feedback off Discord on what I actually need to submit.

## Day 4: 22.07.2018

### Progress: Pushed on with pset4 second question resize.c

I have made a few setup changes to the code and reviewed the course material. Have a decent idea what needs to be done but i'm falling
to sleep at my desk to think i'm going to call it a night.

## Day 5: 23.07.2018

### Progress: Wasn't able to get much screen time in today so just ended up watching the week 5 lecture

Hopefully get more time at the computer tomorrow to get back onto pset4 and hopefully get it finished. Really looking forward to having pset4
& pset5 completed so I can get onto the second half of the course which focuses more on practical web dev projects with html, css, python and 
databases.

## Day 6: 24.07.2018

### Progress: Another day preoccupied with getting my new meap prep and training routine sorted so just watched the week 4 shorts

Not much to report. Spent about 1.5 hours just watching the week 4 shorts in CS50. I would really like to get to a point where I can 
comfortably implement data structures and understand which structure would be most suitable for a given situation.

## Day 7: 25.07.2018

### Progress: Big big day.....of playing Fary Cry 5!

Stuck in holiday mode and want to complete Far Cry 5. Got in a late hour trying to do resize.c though for pset4. Fly out to Bali
for a week tomorrow so won't be doing much coding probably. But I will take my laptop and at least aim to get an hour of reading in each
day on something code related. Probably a JS book to help further my knowledge of the new ES6 stuff and functional programming.

## Day 8: 26.07.2018

### Progress: Fly out to Bali on Holiday....

Coding time is probably going to be kept at a bare minimum as I can barely get internet in my room unless I hang out on the balcony. Downloaded
some books to my kindle and started reading a functional programming with Javascript book on the plane ride over. Hoping to fill my hour a day whilst 
here reading the book and getting a better handle on functional programming. The more a learn about it the more I see it as a must have for building
modular concise code.

## Day 9: 27.07.2018

### Progress: Climbed a mountain today and read an hour worth of functional programming with Javascript

Amazing day trekking to the top of Mount Batur in Bali, the view was incredible. So tired when I came back I tried to read my book and 
started to fall asleep after 6 minutes. Decided to take a power nap and try again later in the evening which worked a treat! I really want to 
figure out this functional prorgramming way of problem solving and understand it will definetely take some time and practice.
