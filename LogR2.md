## Day 1: 19.07.2018

### Progress: Started work on Pset 4 Whodunit for CS50

Went out for dinner and a bit of fun at the casino tonight so it's a very late night boozy 1hr of coding.
Really want to get pset4 & 5 done over the next 5 days before I got on holiday so I can get onto python which
I think is going to be a much more practical language to learn that is relevant to current business.

## Day 2: 20.07.2018

### Progress: Continued with Whodunit for CS50

Trying to get my head around the header info files in Whodunit. Struggling a bit with understanding 
the numbers as nothing seems to line up. I'm sure it will click over the weekend though.

## Day 3: 21.07.2018

### Progress: Completed Whodunit but I still need to submit in the morning

Once i'd wrapped my head around it properly it was just a few lines of code to deal with. Will submit in the morning once I 
get some feedback off Discord on what I actually need to submit.

## Day 4: 22.07.2018

### Progress: Pushed on with pset4 second question resize.c

I have made a few setup changes to the code and reviewed the course material. Have a decent idea what needs to be done but i'm falling
to sleep at my desk to think i'm going to call it a night.

## Day 5: 23.07.2018

### Progress: Wasn't able to get much screen time in today so just ended up watching the week 5 lecture

Hopefully get more time at the computer tomorrow to get back onto pset4 and hopefully get it finished. Really looking forward to having pset4
& pset5 completed so I can get onto the second half of the course which focuses more on practical web dev projects with html, css, python and 
databases.

## Day 6: 24.07.2018

### Progress: Another day preoccupied with getting my new meap prep and training routine sorted so just watched the week 4 shorts

Not much to report. Spent about 1.5 hours just watching the week 4 shorts in CS50. I would really like to get to a point where I can 
comfortably implement data structures and understand which structure would be most suitable for a given situation.

## Day 7: 25.07.2018

### Progress: Big big day.....of playing Fary Cry 5!

Stuck in holiday mode and want to complete Far Cry 5. Got in a late hour trying to do resize.c though for pset4. Fly out to Bali
for a week tomorrow so won't be doing much coding probably. But I will take my laptop and at least aim to get an hour of reading in each
day on something code related. Probably a JS book to help further my knowledge of the new ES6 stuff and functional programming.

## Day 8: 26.07.2018

### Progress: Fly out to Bali on Holiday....

Coding time is probably going to be kept at a bare minimum as I can barely get internet in my room unless I hang out on the balcony. Downloaded
some books to my kindle and started reading a functional programming with Javascript book on the plane ride over. Hoping to fill my hour a day whilst 
here reading the book and getting a better handle on functional programming. The more a learn about it the more I see it as a must have for building
modular concise code.

## Day 9: 27.07.2018

### Progress: Climbed a mountain today and read an hour worth of functional programming with Javascript

Amazing day trekking to the top of Mount Batur in Bali, the view was incredible. So tired when I came back I tried to read my book and 
started to fall asleep after 6 minutes. Decided to take a power nap and try again later in the evening which worked a treat! I really want to 
figure out this functional prorgramming way of problem solving and understand it will definetely take some time and practice.

## Day 10: 28.07.2018

### Progress: The holiday continues...very busy day doing activities, nearly failed but our friends cancelled a night out so here I am getting in my hour!

It must be destiny that I am making this entry before the deadline. Spending the late hours of today in my bed getting an hour of reading time into
this functional programming with Javascript book. Going to make sure I work with some of the exercises and code examples in VS Code with the debugger to help
with my understanding of how the code executes when using recursive return statements.

## Day 11: 29.07.2018

### Progress: The holiday continues...Starting to get stuck on the functional programming book

This book is starting to go over my head as he is bringing in FP libraries like Lodash which I know nothing about and then using methods
both from libraries and native to JS that I am not familiar with. If I am going to learn from this book i'm going to have to take a step back again 
and start working through the code examples and documentation.

## Day 12: 30.07.2018

### Progress: The holiday continues...Nursing a pretty severe hangover but did some work on resize.c

Should have used my time more productively today. Did a very small amount of work on resize.c probably not enough to say I got a full hour
but I am on holiday and I know I'll make up the time shortfall in other days. I definetely have a lot of extra already banked from the previously
111 days!

## Day 13: 31.07.2018

### Progress: The holiday continues...Progressed a little bit further in resize.c

Just about have the code sorted out to update the header and info part of the 
problem. Hopefully tomorrow I can finish off the pixel and padding part and get it submitted.

## Day 14: 01.08.2018

### Progress: The holiday continues...Finished and submitted resize.c for CS50

Managed to get around to a bit of CS50 and got the resize.c problem finalised and submitted, yay!

## Day 15: 02.08.2018

### Progress: Flew home today

Actually submitted resize.c after some technical issues and read a few chapters of Professional
Javascript for Web Developers 3rd Edition on the Plane. Seems a bit out of date but i'm sure there is still plenty in 
there that I can learn.

## Day 16: 03.08.2018

### Progress: Started on recover.c

Built the basic setup for recover.c so that it passes the initial checks with check50. Now I just need to do the hard part
and build out the guts of of the program!

## Day 17: 04.08.2018

### Progress: Started too late so watched week 5 & 6 lectures   

Want to devote a good chunk of time tomorrow to finishing pset4. Going to watch the pset free week 5 and 6 lectures tonight
just because I am hanging out to get back on some web dev stuff and away from pointers and C!

## Day 18: 05.08.2018

### Progress: Another fail day of not doing any coding on pset4! 

Fell asleep last night so finished off the two lectures for week 6. Its good to see a bit of python again. Goal for 
this next week is finish pset4 & 5! It must be done!

## Day 19: 06.08.2018

### Progress: Did some work on Advanced Developer Bootcamp on Udemy

Did not get to sit down at the computer until 10:30pm so just fit in a tired hour working on some ES6 stuff 
as part of Colt Steeles - Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp. I am struggling with this stuff still and think I will for
some time to come. Bit flat at the moment with this slow down in progress

## Day 20: 07.08.2018

### Progress: Did some more work on Advanced Developer Bootcamp on Udemy

Another long day and late start in the evening. Decided to keep going on the Udemy course and implemented a setInterval
function that counts down to 0 in the console and then logs Ring Ring Ring!!! when it hit's zero seconds

## Day 21: 08.08.2018

### Progress: Did some more work on Advanced Developer Bootcamp on Udemy

Finished the async section of the course and moved onto the AJAX section. Mostly just basic exercises and I think some more meaty
projects are not too far away. Still struggle with these callback functions but i'm hopeful with practice it will become second nature.

## Day 22: 09.08.2018

### Progress: Did some more work on Advanced Developer Bootcamp on Udemy

Continued with the Ajax section of the course and did a brief little simple exercise in codepen to update a bitcoin
rate using an API on button click without requiring the page to be refreshed. It was a relatively simple exercise and I kept it very bare
bones where it wasn't handling errors. I've missed working with Javascript with C and CS50 taking up a lot of my time in recent months.
