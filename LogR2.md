## Day 1: 19.07.2018

### Progress: Started work on Pset 4 Whodunit for CS50

Went out for dinner and a bit of fun at the casino tonight so it's a very late night boozy 1hr of coding.
Really want to get pset4 & 5 done over the next 5 days before I got on holiday so I can get onto python which
I think is going to be a much more practical language to learn that is relevant to current business.

## Day 2: 20.07.2018

### Progress: Continued with Whodunit for CS50

Trying to get my head around the header info files in Whodunit. Struggling a bit with understanding 
the numbers as nothing seems to line up. I'm sure it will click over the weekend though.

## Day 3: 21.07.2018

### Progress: Completed Whodunit but I still need to submit in the morning

Once i'd wrapped my head around it properly it was just a few lines of code to deal with. Will submit in the morning once I 
get some feedback off Discord on what I actually need to submit.
