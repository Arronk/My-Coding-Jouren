## Day 1: 19.07.2018

### Progress: Started work on Pset 4 Whodunit for CS50

Went out for dinner and a bit of fun at the casino tonight so it's a very late night boozy 1hr of coding.
Really want to get pset4 & 5 done over the next 5 days before I got on holiday so I can get onto python which
I think is going to be a much more practical language to learn that is relevant to current business.

## Day 2: 20.07.2018

### Progress: Continued with Whodunit for CS50

Trying to get my head around the header info files in Whodunit. Struggling a bit with understanding 
the numbers as nothing seems to line up. I'm sure it will click over the weekend though.

## Day 3: 21.07.2018

### Progress: Completed Whodunit but I still need to submit in the morning

Once i'd wrapped my head around it properly it was just a few lines of code to deal with. Will submit in the morning once I 
get some feedback off Discord on what I actually need to submit.

## Day 4: 22.07.2018

### Progress: Pushed on with pset4 second question resize.c

I have made a few setup changes to the code and reviewed the course material. Have a decent idea what needs to be done but i'm falling
to sleep at my desk to think i'm going to call it a night.

## Day 5: 23.07.2018

### Progress: Wasn't able to get much screen time in today so just ended up watching the week 5 lecture

Hopefully get more time at the computer tomorrow to get back onto pset4 and hopefully get it finished. Really looking forward to having pset4
& pset5 completed so I can get onto the second half of the course which focuses more on practical web dev projects with html, css, python and 
databases.

## Day 6: 24.07.2018

### Progress: Another day preoccupied with getting my new meap prep and training routine sorted so just watched the week 4 shorts

Not much to report. Spent about 1.5 hours just watching the week 4 shorts in CS50. I would really like to get to a point where I can 
comfortably implement data structures and understand which structure would be most suitable for a given situation.

## Day 7: 25.07.2018

### Progress: Big big day.....of playing Fary Cry 5!

Stuck in holiday mode and want to complete Far Cry 5. Got in a late hour trying to do resize.c though for pset4. Fly out to Bali
for a week tomorrow so won't be doing much coding probably. But I will take my laptop and at least aim to get an hour of reading in each
day on something code related. Probably a JS book to help further my knowledge of the new ES6 stuff and functional programming.

## Day 8: 26.07.2018

### Progress: Fly out to Bali on Holiday....

Coding time is probably going to be kept at a bare minimum as I can barely get internet in my room unless I hang out on the balcony. Downloaded
some books to my kindle and started reading a functional programming with Javascript book on the plane ride over. Hoping to fill my hour a day whilst 
here reading the book and getting a better handle on functional programming. The more a learn about it the more I see it as a must have for building
modular concise code.

## Day 9: 27.07.2018

### Progress: Climbed a mountain today and read an hour worth of functional programming with Javascript

Amazing day trekking to the top of Mount Batur in Bali, the view was incredible. So tired when I came back I tried to read my book and 
started to fall asleep after 6 minutes. Decided to take a power nap and try again later in the evening which worked a treat! I really want to 
figure out this functional prorgramming way of problem solving and understand it will definetely take some time and practice.

## Day 10: 28.07.2018

### Progress: The holiday continues...very busy day doing activities, nearly failed but our friends cancelled a night out so here I am getting in my hour!

It must be destiny that I am making this entry before the deadline. Spending the late hours of today in my bed getting an hour of reading time into
this functional programming with Javascript book. Going to make sure I work with some of the exercises and code examples in VS Code with the debugger to help
with my understanding of how the code executes when using recursive return statements.

## Day 11: 29.07.2018

### Progress: The holiday continues...Starting to get stuck on the functional programming book

This book is starting to go over my head as he is bringing in FP libraries like Lodash which I know nothing about and then using methods
both from libraries and native to JS that I am not familiar with. If I am going to learn from this book i'm going to have to take a step back again 
and start working through the code examples and documentation.

## Day 12: 30.07.2018

### Progress: The holiday continues...Nursing a pretty severe hangover but did some work on resize.c

Should have used my time more productively today. Did a very small amount of work on resize.c probably not enough to say I got a full hour
but I am on holiday and I know I'll make up the time shortfall in other days. I definetely have a lot of extra already banked from the previously
111 days!

## Day 13: 31.07.2018

### Progress: The holiday continues...Progressed a little bit further in resize.c

Just about have the code sorted out to update the header and info part of the 
problem. Hopefully tomorrow I can finish off the pixel and padding part and get it submitted.

## Day 14: 01.08.2018

### Progress: The holiday continues...Finished and submitted resize.c for CS50

Managed to get around to a bit of CS50 and got the resize.c problem finalised and submitted, yay!

## Day 15: 02.08.2018

### Progress: Flew home today

Actually submitted resize.c after some technical issues and read a few chapters of Professional
Javascript for Web Developers 3rd Edition on the Plane. Seems a bit out of date but i'm sure there is still plenty in 
there that I can learn.

## Day 16: 03.08.2018

### Progress: Started on recover.c

Built the basic setup for recover.c so that it passes the initial checks with check50. Now I just need to do the hard part
and build out the guts of of the program!

## Day 17: 04.08.2018

### Progress: Started too late so watched week 5 & 6 lectures   

Want to devote a good chunk of time tomorrow to finishing pset4. Going to watch the pset free week 5 and 6 lectures tonight
just because I am hanging out to get back on some web dev stuff and away from pointers and C!

## Day 18: 05.08.2018

### Progress: Another fail day of not doing any coding on pset4! 

Fell asleep last night so finished off the two lectures for week 6. Its good to see a bit of python again. Goal for 
this next week is finish pset4 & 5! It must be done!

## Day 19: 06.08.2018

### Progress: Did some work on Advanced Developer Bootcamp on Udemy

Did not get to sit down at the computer until 10:30pm so just fit in a tired hour working on some ES6 stuff 
as part of Colt Steeles - Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp. I am struggling with this stuff still and think I will for
some time to come. Bit flat at the moment with this slow down in progress

## Day 20: 07.08.2018

### Progress: Did some more work on Advanced Developer Bootcamp on Udemy

Another long day and late start in the evening. Decided to keep going on the Udemy course and implemented a setInterval
function that counts down to 0 in the console and then logs Ring Ring Ring!!! when it hit's zero seconds

## Day 21: 08.08.2018

### Progress: Did some more work on Advanced Developer Bootcamp on Udemy

Finished the async section of the course and moved onto the AJAX section. Mostly just basic exercises and I think some more meaty
projects are not too far away. Still struggle with these callback functions but i'm hopeful with practice it will become second nature.

## Day 22: 09.08.2018

### Progress: Did some more work on Advanced Developer Bootcamp on Udemy

Continued with the Ajax section of the course and did a brief little simple exercise in codepen to update a bitcoin
rate using an API on button click without requiring the page to be refreshed. It was a relatively simple exercise and I kept it very bare
bones where it wasn't handling errors. I've missed working with Javascript with C and CS50 taking up a lot of my time in recent months.

## Day 23: 10.08.2018

### Progress: Did some more work on Advanced Developer Bootcamp on Udemy

Continued with AJAX functionality and got started on the part 2 AJAX section which introduced JQuery involvement and Axios

## Day 24: 11.08.2018

### Progress: Attended a FCC meetup and completed pset4 Finally!

A good day finally being able to spend a decent portion of time on my coding. Hosted a 4 hour FCC monthly meetup which
was great to see mostly new faces joining us but I did not get much coding in like usual. Then I mustered up the courage to finally
give pset4 a solid crack to get it compeleted. After much frustration I got it to work. The solution seems so simple after the 
fact!

## Day 25: 12.08.2018

### Progress: Started the final C pset5 - Hard Mode

This final C pset looks rather difficult but based on my readings since I started programming I think it is very important I slow down
take my time with this one regardless of how much I am itching to move away from C. I plan on first building linked lists, hash tables and tries
in a very simple form outside of the pset to get an understanding of how it works then try implement each into the solving the 
problem.

## Day 26: 13.08.2018

### Progress: Continued with the final C pset5 - Hard Mode

spent time messing around with different files in Cloud 9 to properly understand pointers. Have been reviewing 
the short vids again for the third or fourth time. I'm going to understand this and get this pset finished this 
week!

## Day 27: 14.08.2018

### Progress: Continued with the final C pset5 - Hard Mode

Working through the lecture and src5 code examples specifically focusing only on linked lists for tonight.
I don't really have a full understanding on the syntax and implementation process yet but I understand
what we are trying to do. I need to build my own linked list!

## Day 28: 15.08.2018

### Progress: Continued with the final C pset5 - Hard Mode

Finished working through all the Src5 examples in detail as well as thoroughly rewatched the weekly lecture. Started
Progressing through all the weekly shorts again building a few practice exercises to continue building up my foundational
knowledge of structures, C syntax to prep me for doing this pset5 correctly.

## Day 29: 16.08.2018

### Progress: Continued with the final C pset5 - Hard Mode

Spent the night implementing my own singly linked list data structure will full CRUD functionality. Don't think i'll 
have time to finish it all off the way I want it to be tonight but will make sure it is done tomorrow. It has been 
an enjoyable night where I'm implementing things and it is working yipee! Nights like this are very rewarding.

## Day 30: 17.08.2018

### Progress: The best-laid plans of mice and men often go awry

My big plan to keep the good momentum going from last night never eventuated. Finished work almost fell asleep then 
down to the gym for 1.5hours for my sons kickboxing then meal prep as I have nothing ready for tomorrow and now its currently
10:48pm as I write this and I have planned to go for a 6:30am surf! Will cram in an hour, do what I can and smash it on
the weekend.

## Day 31: 18.08.2018

### Progress: Some progress on my data structure adventures

Spent most of the day trying to figure out bugs and memory leaks. In hindsight I should have posted my question to
stack sooner as it was answered within a matter of minutes in perfectly understandable english for a simpleton like
me! I'll just take it as a learner experience and keep on moving with my program!

## Day 32: 19.08.2018

### Progress: Finished my SLL Project

Hopefully I have met Ranjit's criteria for my little linked list exercise. I have definetely learned a lot doing this one
even if it consumed the best part of my entire weekend. On to hash tables and tries next!

[SLL Project Repository](https://github.com/Arronk/Singly-Linked-List-CRUD)

## Day 33: 20.08.2018

### Progress: Delved into the world of hash functions

Now moving onto hash tables I spent most of the night looking for a suitable hash function as the pset allowed 
it provided I cite my sources. So far I have been trying to pull apart the djb2 hash function. bitwise operators and 
some cryptic syntax made understanding a little tricky but I think I am starting to under stand how it works in theory
but the math is a little beyond me haha.

## Day 34: 21.08.2018

### Progress: Sidetracked tonight!

Spent most of the night chatting to my CS50 study partner and reviewing Coursera, Edx and Udacity to see what micromasters,
masters and other certificates they offer that may be useful to enrol in going forwards. I think for the time being FCC, the OSSU
Curriculum, Udemy and fast.ai is going to keep my plenty busy for the next couple of years but some of these courses look 
interesting specifically the AI for trading on Udacity!

## Day 35: 22.08.2018

### Progress: Back onto hashtables and pset5

Nothing too fancy tonight. Trying to convert my SLL projects into a hash table implementation. Once this is finished
i'll get onto doing pset5. I wanted to also do tries but I really need to keep moving with this unit!

## Day 36: 23.08.2018

### Progress: Hitting my head against a brick wall tonight

Not having much luck with this hashtable structure tonight. I do understand what we are doing at a fundamental level
and can write the pseudo but I am struggling with the syntax and pointers like usual!

## Day 37: 24.08.2018

### Progress: Still Bashing my head against the wall

made almost no progress on this hashtable tonight, really feel like giving up ugh...

## Day 38: 25.08.2018

### Progress: Had a bit of a breakthrough

So I finally had a breakthrough with my hashtable today and figured out how each bucket in the area could act as the head
of a singly linked list. Hoping to have the insert function finished before I go to bed tonight!

## Day 39: 26.08.2018

### Progress: Hashtable Success!

After my breakthrough yesterday the floodgates opened and the rest of the program was relatively straight forward. I 
had a real "ah-hah" moment when I realised the cause of my seg fault errors, one that will hopefully be a lasting lesson
to take forward with me. All program files were uploaded to my github repo linked below.

- [Helper file](https://github.com/Arronk/Singly-Linked-List-and-Hastable-CRUD/blob/master/hashstruct.h)
- [Hash Executable program](https://github.com/Arronk/Singly-Linked-List-and-Hastable-CRUD/blob/master/swanhash.c)

## Day 40: 27.08.2018

### Progress: Back onto pset5! This week I will destroy it!

Got back onto pset5 tonight. Mostly reading the speller.c file. Also listed to a freecodecamp podcast. I will destroy this 
pset this week, I am full of confidence now I have successfully completed my other programs.

## Day 41: 28.08.2018

### Progress: Very late start so just watched the Week 7 Lecture

Put pset5 aside tonight as I started late and was quite tired. Decided to watch the week 7 lecture instead but struggling
to keep the eyes open. No training tomorrow so plenty of time to make up lost ground for the week then!

## Day 42: 29.08.2018

### Progress: Finished watching the week 7 lecture

Well my meal prep and new nutrition plan totally took front and center tonight so barelly squeezed in 30 mins finishing off the week 7
lecture. I'm a little behind my hour a day this week but i'll catch it up on the weekend.

## Day 43: 30.08.2018

### Progress: Finished all the text questions in pset5

Made some progress by getting all the questions completed for pset5. Just the code left to write. This weekend is going to be the winner (yes I know I have said
that for about the past 4 now haha).

## Day 44: 31.08.2018

### Progress: Making good progress on pset5, hopefully finish it tonight!

Written 2 of the 4 functions in pset5, if I don't finish tonight I will definetely have this one cracked tomorrow!

## Day 45: 01.09.2018

### Progress: Completed PSET5!

Very happy to write that today I finished and submitted pset5! This marks the end of the my journey with C for the time being and onto python, JS and all the rest
to finish off the final psets of the course. It has been difficult but rewarding doing the first 6 psets and its a good achievement to get the motivation
juices flowing once again.

## Day 46: 02.09.2018

### Progress: Completed most of Sentiiments in PSET6 and started an MIT python course

Did most of the ports of previous C programs over to python which turned out trickier then expected. I really struggled to read the 
python documentation, it was definately not newbie friendly in my opinion. Bart and I decided to do a quick (2 month or less) detour
into the MIT intro to comp science with python course to brush up on python skills before moving forward.

## Day 47: 03.09.2018

### Progress: Completed the psets from week 1 of the MIT 6.00x Course

Needed to check stack over flow for a couple of syntax issues I was having in my program solutions but 
overall I managed to get the three psets questions from week 1 done without too much hassle. I think my solution
to the third question was a bit WET and sloppy but i passed the checks so I am going to move on. Started readin the 
course text book tonight to further my understanding whilst I wait for the next week of content to be released.
