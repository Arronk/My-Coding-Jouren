## Day 1: 31.10.2018

### Progress: Almost finished off the remaining Intermediate Algos on FCC

I find some of these intermediate algos are significantly harder then the others. Stuck 
again tonight trying to do something that should probably be simple, looping over a variable
amount of nested arrays and return the elements inside them. 

## Day 2: 01/11/2018

### Progress: Got cracking on Week 2 6.002x exercises

Probabilities galore so far this week. Finding some questions quite tricky where they are asking
for the smallest fraction calculations on some larger numbers. Hope to have week 2 finished nice and 
quickly so I can get back to FCC and cs50

## Day 3: 02/11/2018

### Progress: Finished the week 2 exercises and got started on the psets

The rest of the exercises for week 2 were pretty straight forward. It was more focused on working out 
probability then it was writing code though!

## Day 4: 03/11/2018

### Progress: Spent most of the day fixing a computer instead of coding grrrr

My mate's pc wasn't working so I spent the day playing around with hardware and getting the right OS installed
on his new SSD. Turned out he installed a 32 bit Windows which meant even after I upgraded it, it was still unable to
run most of his games which required a 64 bit OS. After about 5 hours we got there in the end!

## Day 5: 04/11/2018

### Progress: Having fun working through pset2 for MIT 6.00.2x

Felt a little bit lost when first attempting to solve the first question of pset2. Once I realised I had to 
implement a data structure to store the cleaned/not cleaned states of tiles in the room it was pretty easy
after that point. Everything in this course is OOP which I am enjoying get the opportunity to practice more.

## Day 6: 05/11/2018

### Progress: Having fun working through pset2 for MIT 6.00.2x cont...

Managed to finish Questions 2 & 3 of pset2 tonight. I am enjoying this pset is it a good level of challenge
to better my understanding of OOP. The functions and classes themselves are relatively straight forward but i'm
finding it still to be a good challenge as I become more familiar with the syntax.

## Day 7: 06/11/2018

### Progress: Finished pset2 for 6.00.2x!

Finished off the rest of pset2 without too much issues tonight. It was very interesting to run some
of the simulations to see what effect changes in different variables had on the timesteps.I did not expect
the results from the aspect ratio plot. Also now only have 1 javascript project left before I get my 
first FCC cert!

## Day 8: 07/11/2018

### Progress: Got my first FCC Certificate FINALLY!!

Well i'm very happy tonight that I managed to knock out the cash register problem in about 3-4 hours and 
claimed my first certificate with Freecodecamp! Happy to finally have at least one of the certificates
under my belt after numerous detours to other courses over the past 12 months.

## Day 9: 08/11/2018

### Progress: Hardware day!

Been watching a lot of PC builds over the past week which has motivated me to pull mine apart, give it 
a clean and try and fix up all my messy cable management. Pretty pleased with the outcome and i'm kinda 
glad I did it as the radiator was caked in dust.

## Day 10: 09/11/2018

### Progress:Learning how to Learn with Coursera

OK so not really coding today because I wanted to address my learning in general with the hopes
it will make my learning to code more effective and help me with some procrastination issues I've
been struggling with lately. So far the Coursera course it very interesting with lots of 
resources but nothing too ground breaking yet that is giving me an ah-hah moment.

## Day 11: 10/11/2018

### Progress:Learning how to Learn with Coursera and FCC Meetup

Hosted the monthly Freecodecamp meetup today and spent a couple of hours talking code which 
is always enjoyable. For the rest of the day I tried to complete the entire learning to learn course
in the day but I think i'll not get the final assignment done tonight, hopefully tomorrow. It's pretty funny
though as I'm probably going against some of the teachings in the course by trying to do it all in a day as it has
been proven to be less effective then steady repeitition over time to let the ideas form chunks haha. 

## Day 12: 11/11/2018

### Progress: Finished Learning how to learn and implemented the first function in pset8 CS50

I was a bit dissappointed with where I finished in Learning how to learn. Nothing too ground breaking 
really. I was hoping for some kind of ah-hah moment that would cure my procrastination that didn't 
eventuate! Got back to pset8 today for cs50 and after much failure trying to get the google news rss
working for my aussie zip code it just wouldn't work so I went back to using US ones to get the job 
done. managed to implement the /articles logic and tomorrow I should have /search done.

## Day 13: 12/11/2018

### Progress: Busy night so just a bit of revision

Not enough time tonight to get stuck back into pset8 so just did some revision in preparation
for the next FCC certificate.

## Day 14: 13/11/2018

### Progress: Did some more FCC and attended a local Big Data Event

Went into the city to see some local experts talk about Big data and what's going in the local scene.
It was pretty interesting but nothing too ground breaking I hadn't already read about on Medium tbh.
Up to new stuff again in FCC which is fun but I really need to get back to CS50!

## Day 15: 14/11/2018

### Progress: Moved onto the React section of FCC

I knew this day would come eventually but today I ventured into the rabbit hole they call React. I
have a feeling this is something that will take some time to master and I purposely havne't rushed into
a JS framework as I wanted to get more familiar with Vanilla JS and programming in general first. I'm
now up to this section in FCC so I guess I might as well get my feet wet.

## Day 16: 15/11/2018

### Progress: Continued with the React section of FCC

Cruising through the React section but have hit a few more challenging ones just as I write this. I am 
comfortable though that it is just a syntax problem that will get better with practice. Hoping to have all
the core React component before I go to sleep.
