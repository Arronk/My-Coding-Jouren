## Day 1: 31.10.2018

### Progress: Almost finished off the remaining Intermediate Algos on FCC

I find some of these intermediate algos are significantly harder then the others. Stuck 
again tonight trying to do something that should probably be simple, looping over a variable
amount of nested arrays and return the elements inside them. 

## Day 2: 01/11/2018

### Progress: Got cracking on Week 2 6.002x exercises

Probabilities galore so far this week. Finding some questions quite tricky where they are asking
for the smallest fraction calculations on some larger numbers. Hope to have week 2 finished nice and 
quickly so I can get back to FCC and cs50

## Day 3: 02/11/2018

### Progress: Finished the week 2 exercises and got started on the psets

The rest of the exercises for week 2 were pretty straight forward. It was more focused on working out 
probability then it was writing code though!
