## Day 1-5: 10.04.2018 - 14.04.2018

### Progress: Was not set up on Github for first 5 days please refer to my daily tweets for details

## Day 6: 15.04.2018

### Progress: I completed section 12-14 on Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp (Udemy)

Coding was mostly focussed on DOM Manipulation and I would have appreciated more worked exercises as it was definitely all new to me and the syntax will take some time to understand and save to memory.

## Day 7: 16.04.2018

### Progress: Learned how to use Git / Cloud 9 / Github and cloned the 100DaysofCode Repo 

This was rather painful but after a bit of trial and error and some tutorials I picked up the basic git process via the Cloud 9 IDE. Git status, add ., reset .,commit & push. I would probably like to review a bit more about Git now that I understand the basic premise around how it works so that I am better prepared when it comes to working in a team environment. 
I cloned the repo as my commits were not counting to my contributions graph when working with the forked version of the 100DaysofCode Repo.

## Day 8: 17.04.2018

### Progress: Completed Section 15 on Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp (Udemy)

Spent several hours following the code along to the Color Guessing Game Project. I did pause the videos in areas to build sections of the project I had a handle on before Colt showed the solution. I think I would have still struggled to build this entirely on my own, especially in a couple of hours. The project did give me a good oppurtunity to further 
understand and utilise the recent teachings in DOM manipulation which had gone a little over my head. JQuery next!

## Day 9: 18.04.2018

### Progress: Completed Section 16 Into to JQuery   

Read a couple of intersting articles on Medium and watched an episode of the Coding Train on Youtube. The guy makes building a neural network look
so easy, I hope I get to that level of proficiency eventually. The JQuery module was a bit of a let down, only one very basic exercise and lots of video content.
Colt presents the information well and i'm glad he spent more time on vanilla JS DOM manipulation first. FCC does it the other way around and I found it easier to put 
context around JQuery's use this time around due to the order in which the content was delivered.

## Day 10: 19.04.2018

### Progress: Completed Section 17-18 Advanced JQuery and Todo List Project   

Spent most of the day doing the code along to the Todo List Project. Its starting to feel like the entirety of this Udemy course is going to be just code alongs which is not going to be as beneficial to my learning as I first thought. I'm definately still learning a lot and it's great to see 
an experienced Developer like Colt work through a project so I can get used to understanding the process. The JQuery Library seems relatively straight forward and definately simplifies vanilla JS DOM Manipulation. Almost onto the backend part of the course now. Planning to get back into the FCC curriculum
and aim towards finishing the front end certificate. I find FCC throws you in the deep end and expects you to sink or swim which I think I am now ready to take on that challenge.

## Day 11: 20.04.2018

### Progress: Learning Paper.js as part of a new quick project

Had some good fun learning about paper.js and playing around with the examples on their website with my kids. Did not get time to finish the exercise as 
I hit a brickwall trying to figure out how to get correct syntax highlighting in Sublime Text 3 for paperscript. After well over an hour of troubleshooting I gave
up and will just resort to using a different text editor like Notepad++ or VS Code when using paperscript in future.

## Day 12: 21.04.2018

### Progress: The project did not turn out to be so quick!

Spent a good amount of time hitting my head against a brick wall trying to read through docs and have the canvas display a 10  x 10 purple grid of circles using paperJS. I managed to get it working but on looking at the solution video was disappointed with how simple the solution was.

## Day 13: 22.04.2018

### Progress: Finished off the Project and loaded it onto Codepen

Finished the paperJS project and loaded it up to codepen. Had a lot of issue trying to figure out how to get sound files hosting and working on codepen but I got there in the end. Also had a bit of a hard time figuring out how to have the document running on localhost to get rid of the error messages.
I managed to get that one sorted as well once I realised something was not enabled. Back end part of the course starts next which I'm really looking forward too.

## Day 14: 23.04.2018

### Progress: Got stuck into the backend section of Colt Steeles Web Developer Bootcamp 20-23

Sections completed include: Backend Basics, The Command Line, Node JS & Server Side Frameworks. I just have the Express Basics Exercise to 
complete to finish Section 23. I'm hoping to knock out a couple of sections per day and have the entire course finished by the end of next week. I also spent some time
further updating my codepen account with some of my work  to share and made another attempt at getting my Github page looking more how I like it, as yet I am unsuccesful.
On a final note PaperJS codepen got chosen as a picked pen, stoked!

## Day 15: 24.04.2018

### Progress: Completed the express assignment on Colt's Udemy course and continued with intermediate Express

Completed the assignment albeit requiring a couple of hints for the final bits of the it. Problem areas were setting up the kev value pairs for the animal sounds
then accessing those pairs as well as the showing the string looped num times with spaces in between. Spent some more time in the evening with 
intermediate but i'm falling asleep at the wheel and think I need to take a break. In a pizza coma right now!

## Day 16: 25.04.2018

### Progress: Started the final YelpCamp Project and made a Vimeo of progress so far    

Up to Section 26 in Colt's Web Dev Bootcamp on Udemy. Started the final YelpCamp Project and made a short video just 
highlighting some of the small pieces that are done so far. Will probably upload the backend files into my Github
repo over the coming days just so everything is in the same place. I definately think I need to start doing some of my
own work for a while once i'm done with this course to cement what I have learned recently.

[YelpCamp Video 1](https://vimeo.com/266490571)

## Day 17: 26.04.2018

### Progress: Continued Progressing through the YelpCamp Project   

A lot of interuptions today but managed to fit a couple of night owl hours after downing a couple bottles of wine. Completed
the YelpCamp Basics and have the home, campgrounds and add campgrounds page routes working and some basic styling
with Bootstrap. Will provide an update video tomorrow when I am have more time to do it properly.

## Day 18: 27.04.2018

### Progress: Continued Progressing through the YelpCamp Project + Built a Restful Blog App

Put in a solid days work on my last day of annual leave trying to finish of Colt's course on Udemy.
Continued progressing through the YelpCamp project and then detoured to build a RESTful Blog App. I really enjoyed
this code along and I think with practice this process should become relatively straight forward as there isn't 
much requirement for algorithmic thinking, more so just syntax and styling. Video link of the blog below:

[Restful Blog App Video](https://youtu.be/A9-P11b2y_k)

## Day 19: 28.04.2018

### Progress: Did some work on Section 30 - Data Associations and created a new Extras.md file on my my_coding_journey repo

Spent a fair amount of time building my Extras.md addition to my main repository which I hope to share with the community. The article that
inspired the change really hit home on a few points that I think will add a lot of value to my journey, the people I connect with and the
content and share with the online community.

[Extras](Extras.md)

## Day 20: 29.04.2018

### Progress: Travelling to Sydney so hard to get too much work done. Spent some time reading into how to contribute to FCC Open Source on Github

Did some reading on research on the FCC Github repo as to how to get started making contributions to their beginner and starter issues. Watched another
video series on contributing to Open Source and how to set up Git and work with repository maintainers. I set up a GIT key for my local PC but I think
I'll continue to work within the CLoud 9 IDE as I am more familiar with it.

## Day 21: 30.04.2018

### Progress: Failing so hard!!!!!!!!!!!!

Spent a couple of hours and had to give up so I could get some sleep for work tomorrow (or later today!) Wanted to get the setup for FCC sorted but couldnt
figure out how to get a recent enough version of Mongodb via Cloud 9 so tried to set it up on my local computer. Could get Mongod & Mongo working but
could not for the life of me get the windows service working properly. Try again tomorrow I guess!

## Day 22: 01.05.2018

### Progress: Still failing, but progress!

Well several more hours trying to set up the development environment to contribute to FCC. They make it so god dam hard, the tutorials are pretty vague
in a lot of areas. The only thing I have left to do is do the final git bas commands without error and get the clone to work on localost3000. Hoping i'll
get some assistance to help get me over this last hump because I'm running out of ideas.

## Day 23: 02.05.2018

### Progress: Success.....kinda

Finally managed to get through everything required to get FCC running locally yipee! Hit another hiccup near the finish line with a 3D bug but after 5-6 attempts
different password links I found one that I got to work as it looked pretty close the comment found on the bug report. Looks like there are no first timer
issues available on FCC right so I think i'll go back and finish the Web Dev Course off.

## Day 24: 03.05.2018

### Progress: Did some further research on the MEAN stack and played around with the setup on my laptop 

Not much too report really, spent a couple of hours reading and playing around with my MEAN stack setup and testing it on my local PC

## Day 25: 04.05.2018

### Progress: Finished working on the MEAN stack setup on my laptop. 

Focused on MVC, how Node.js works and connecting MongoDB. Nothing too exciting and looking forward to getting back to 
my courses.

## Day 26: 05.05.2018

### Progress: Completed Section 31/32 on the Web Dev Bootcamp 

Worked through YelpCamp comments and was introduced to authentication.
Produced a working authentication login,login,register process.

## Day 27: 06.05.2018

### Progress: Completed Section 33/34 on the Web Dev Bootcamp 

Added authentication to the YelpCamp site, refactored routes and assigned user
associations to comments and campgrounds. Added update and destroy functionality
to the campgrounds and just need make sure that also has authentication controls tomorrow.

## Day 28: 07.05.2018

### Progress: Almost completed Section 35

Training tonight always eats into my coding time but i manage to get in a 
good hour and half trying to finish off this YelpCamp Project. Hit a couple
of bugs in my code that took up my time finding and correcting but good
experience none the less. Added Authorisation controls to edit/delete
campgrounds plus added an edit button to the comments and created edit/update routes.

## Day 29: 08.05.2018

### Progress: Completed Section 35 and nearly finished 36 and the end of the YelpCamp Project

"1 step forward and 2 steps back" would sum up tonight pretty well. Decided to slow down the pace
and spent some of the night styling the login, signup and create/edit pages of the site prior to it
being done in the code along. Managed to do it pretty easily and did an upate and fresh for each 
style to see how it effected the rendered page. Also spent some time reviewing bootstrap docs. Got
stuck for over an hour on a bug to find out it was just a missing "c" in success grrrrrr.... Not long 
left on the course now I think the hardest part is behind me.

## Day 30: 09.05.2018

### Progress: Thought I finished Section 36 and then I got to the last slide...

Added a cool landing page, included dynamic price feature and made some 
minor aesthetic changes. Thought I was finished until I hit the last slide
which includes a barage of different optional UI improvements.

## Day 31: 10.05.2018

### Progress: Had fun completing the optional extras to the YelpCamp Project

Most of the extra components are now added into the project. Managed to finish
the hamburger menu, pricing feature, google maps location and
finally the time since created functionality with moment js.

## Day 32: 11.05.2018

### Progress: Added an admin user function to the project and user profile

Still pushing on through these optional extras for the YelpCamp project. I'm really enjoying it. Fixed up the 
routes so all comments attached to a campground are deleted if the campground gets deleted. Also added user admin
functionality and a user profile. Still a solid few hours left of coding to finish off all these extras
over the weekend.

## Day 33: 12.05.2018

### Progress: Added fuzzy search and password reset to the YelpCamp Project

Had to deal with a few bugs today but added fuzzy search and a password reset feature. Hoping to get the rest finished in a big day 
tomorrow.

## Day 34: 13.05.2018

### Progress: Finished up the Bootcamp course Yay!

Finally finished the course after successfully deploying it on Heroku. Link provided in the description. What to do next hmmmmm....

[YelpCamp Project](https://yelpcamp-arronk.herokuapp.com/)

## Day 35: 14.05.2018

### Progress: Went back to FCC, went back over the Jquery tutorials quickly and got started on the Tribute Page Project

Nothing too exciting today, decided I would detour back to FCC to re-attempt a couple of FCC front end projects and
the basic javascript algorithms before I head back to do Colt Steele's advanced web developer bootcamp. Once I have a 
few projects under my belt without any reference to the answers I think i'll go back to CS50 and finish that off.

## Day 36: 15.05.2018

### Progress: Spent today messing around with VS Code trying to set it all up and playing around with different lint configs 

Nothing exciting, just setting up VScode and setting up linting configs

## Day 37: 16.05.2018

### Progress: Familiarising myself with the Bootstrap 4 extension in VSCode 

Played around with the bootstrap 4 extension in VS Code and raised an issue on the 
github page for what I believed was incorrect default code for two of the alert triggers.
Will continue working my way through it this week and then get the tribute page done.

## Day 38: 17.05.2018

### Progress: Familiarising myself with the Bootstrap 4 extension in VSCode cont...

I'm about half way through the Bootstrap Documentation. Have made a couple of preliminary items for the tribute
page along the way. Nothing much else really interesting to report except that I revisted Cybrary today and I
think i'll finish the Comp TIA A+ course at some point in the near future as it looks really interesting.

## Day 39: 18.05.2018

### Progress: Finish going over the Bootstrap Documentation and did a lot of other reading

Nothing interesting to report, will get the Tribute Page completed tomorrow, no frills.

## Day 40: 19.05.2018

### Progress: Completed the Tribute Page!

Well I realised today I have a whole lot to learn in the realm of website design. Happy that I finished the
entire project "on my own" only referring to Bootstrap Docs and google search to find answers to queries that I 
had. I loaded it up on Github and my Codepen Account

[Tribute Page](https://arronk.github.io/Tribute-Page/)

## Day 41: 20.05.2018

### Progress: Did a bit of work on The Advanced Developer Bootcamp and Pair Coded a Blog 

Started progressing through Colt Steele's advanced developer bootcamp and then met a guy to start pair programming with.
It was good to finally do some pair programming and conversation with another aspiring programmer.

## Day 42: 21.05.2018

### Progress: A day of research!

Spent the evening trawling the web researching ideas for my portfolio project. I want to learn a lot on this
portfolio project and I want to do a good job. I found some great resources and made reference to them in 
file in my working directory. Codrops is an absolutely awesome site!

## Day 43: 22.05.2018

### Progress: Keyframes & Sunset Cycles

Spent the evening working through Colt Steeles Keyframe exercise for the sunset/sunrise cycle. Changing colour skys, sun and sun arch. 

[Keyframe Sunrise/Sunset](https://codepen.io/Arronk/pen/RydqeK)

## Day 44: 23.05.2018

### Progress: Responsive Sunset Cycles

Really wanted to make my sunset cycle responsive on my own so went about doing just that. I think I did it so it looked nice. Only the iphone 5 resolution looked a bit 
out of wack but who cares about iphone5 right? Probably lots of people..... 

## Day 45: 24.05.2018

### Progress: More Responsive Design with Colt Steeles Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp

Completed a few exercises that were not code alongs which made for an interesting challenge I enjoyed. Just about 
finished the holy grail responsive design but it's about to hit midnight and I want to make sure I make my daily 
update in time. Also managed to help somebody on #100daysofCode with responsive nav design which
which a nice experience. All exercise links below. 

- [Responsive Holy Grail](https://codepen.io/Arronk/pen/yjWwPz)
- [Simple Flexbox Nav Starter](https://codepen.io/Arronk/pen/ELzdNN)

## Day 46: 25.05.2018

### Progress: Finished The CSS Section of Colt's Course

Finished the responsive web site project on Colt's Course and then started researching templates and tried to ascertain 
whether it is a waste of time to get very good at front end with such strong templates all over the internet already. I think
having a moderate understanding of the syntax and responsive design should be sufficient. Also spent some time using HTTrack to
clone some sites and play around with templates to try and learn some of these cool animations.

## Day 47: 26.05.2018

### Progress: Finished my Responsive Hero Website Template + Made a Youtube Tutorial

Very happy to have finished the hero website template with what I believe is now a fully responsive design from 300px - 4k.
Also put together a quick youtube tutorial on using github images in your codepens. Now back to finishing the advanced 
CSS course on Udemy!

## Day 48: 27.05.2018

### Progress: Progressed in Advanced CSS Course as well as Comp tia a+ on Cybrary

This advanced CSS Course is really great and the instructor is providing some great tips which is helping a lot
with structuing my CSS more modularly as well as usual shortcuts in my editor. I'm learning a lot and i'm keen to get 
stuck into the projects more. Also finished all the intro stuff on the comp tia a+ course too.

## Day 49: 28.05.2018

### Progress: Learned about SASS SCSS and man do I like it! Also watch a couple of Cybrary Vids 

Learning about SASS and SCSS and then compiling it has given me a lot of perspective about how
I can approach styling in a much more professional manner. That responsive hero website I posted back on day
47 really needs to be completely redone as I now see it as a messy piece of crap in dire need of refactoring haha.

## Day 50: 29.05.2018

### Progress: Night turned into a shit fight with VS Code and getting the SASS live server to function and compile my code 

Continued with the course but got stuck on bugs in VS Code. Not happy, nothing more to say for tonight!

## Day 51: 30.05.2018

### Progress: Watched motherboard vids in Cybrary and then made some progress on my Advanced CSS Course 

Managed to fix my VS Code before logging off last which I was quite please with. Today was not as productive as I 
would have like with several interruptions but I definately got in a solid hour or two of coding and watching vids.

## Day 52: 31.05.2018

### Progress: Created a tutorial vid to help people sign into FCC on the new platform plus progressed with the CSS Course 

Typical night on the computer. When i want to make a quick video I can't use geforce broadcast. Found a tool that did the job
and then it saved in the wrong format. Long story short I got it working and uploaded to youtube and shared on social media. 
Hopefully it ends up being helpful to somebody. Continued progressing through the advanced css course and finished the second section of the page.

## Day 53: 01.06.2018

### Progress: Watched more vids on Cyrbary and did a bunch of questions on FCC

Started quite late tonight so just spent a couple of hours doing some easy stuff. Watched some vids on Cyrbary
about different storage devices and then did quite a few of the new questions in the FCC Curriculum. Plan to spend
the weekend really going hard on the Advanced CSS Course. I'm hoping I can get the entire course finsihed!

## Day 54: 02.06.2018

### Progress: Finished all the responsive questions on FCC and progressed through the advanced CSS Course

In the AM i did all the responsive section questions in FCC so I just have to finish the 5 projects to finally get a certificate 
on that platform. In the PM continued on with the Natours project in the advanced CSS course. Spent most of the time trying
to create this flipping card effect in the code along which was pretty tricky. It is going to take a lot of practice and 
projects to be able to do this stuff on my own.

## Day 55: 03.06.2018

### Progress: Completed a big chunk of the Natours Project

Added several new sections to the webpage and lots of animations and functionality. 
Should have all of part 2 completed tomorrow night and onto the final part to make the site responsive.

## Day 56: 04.06.2018

### Progress: Finally finished the monster Part 2 of the Natours Project

Pretty unproductive night. Hit a few hiccups in the code along that delayed me, then I helped some guys 
on gitter with their code. I also realised tonight even though I could copy the elements of this particular
website again I still have a lot of trouble doing something on my own from scratch. I have to get better
at designing the layout and framework of the page.

## Day 57: 05.06.2018

### Progress: Progressed through part of the final responsive section of the Natours Project

Watched a few Cybrary vids which I'm starting to just think is a waste of time and then jumped 
into the final responsive section of the Natours project. Jonas always makes it look so easy and I guess
it is if you know what you are doing, where to change and styling to do to change it. I guess that all comes
with time. Still really enjoying the course but this responsive section is not as enjoyable creating the 
features.

## Day 58: 06.06.2018

### Progress: Progressed through part of the final responsive section of the Natours Project

Groundhog day! Basically did the same as yesterday watched some vids then continued making 
the Natours site responsive. I definately feel the same way as yesterday that Jonas rushed 
this section of his course a little bit smashing out each section without any deep explanation.
I'll give the popup card a go on my own tomorrow night and try and finish the responsive section and Natours
Project then load onto Github.

## Day 59: 07.06.2018

### Progress: Finished all the video content on the Natours Project 

Finished all of the content on the Natours Project but tomorrow night I would like to finish
making the popup responsive before loading to Github and saying I have completed it. Looking
forward to the Flex project that is up next!

## Day 60: 08.06.2018

### Progress: Long day travelling then spending time with family but got some night owl time in 

Trying to get this dam popup responsive for the Natours project so I can call it finished and move on
but I have trouble with even the simplest of issues. Going to keep going to night and hopefully have it loaded up on
the gittest of hubs before I go to bed.

## Day 61: 09.06.2018

### Progress: Kept troubleshooting some bugs in the live release of the Natours Project

Did not get as much time as I would have like to in today but still would have got in an hour. Spent some time
working on fixing minor bugs in the live version of the Natours Project. The animations weren't loading correctly
and some anchor tags were not playing nice in mobile view which I needed fixed

## Day 62: 09.06.2018

### Progress: Fixed all the Natours bugs started project 2  

Finished the project this morning and I happy with how it all works now from desktop to mobile. It isn't perfect in
2k-4k monitor range but i'm not overly concerned with that as it does not seem to be a big focus in the web space at 
this point in time. Now i'm going to get proper stuck into Project 2...cya tomorrow!

- [Natours Project](https://arronk.github.io/Natours-sass/)

## Day 63: 10.06.2018

### Progress: Almost finished the much smaller Project 2 

Started and almost finished the much smaller project 2 which focuses on Flex but Jonas cleverely manages
to introduce other cool design tricks in to keep things interesting. I'm hoping to have this entire course finished
by the end of the next week. Met somebody on Twitter today who wants to do the CS50 course so I think i'm going 
to go back and tackle that one next.

## Day 64: 11.06.2018

### Progress: Finished Project 2 of the Advanced CSS Course

Not much to say, finished the project it was quite fun and I still have lots to learn in regards
to Flex or more specifically I need to practice, practice, practice! Links to the live demo below.

- [Live Demo](https://arronk.github.io/Trillo/)

## Day 65: 12.06.2018

### Progress: Completed all the videos and some small CSS Grid exercises in the Udemy Course

Went through all the intro lessons and exerc3I 111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111111q1Q+++1ises for the CSS Grid Course. Will get started on the main
project tomorrow  with the aim to have the entire course finished by the weekend. My next goal is to 
complete the responsive certificate on FCC as well as complete CS50.

## Day 66: 13.06.2018

### Progress: Did some revision on CS50 psets 

Spent some time revising psets from last year so I could refamiliarize myself with C again. It is going 
to be a difficult unit but I really need to be able to pass the dam intro unit if I really want to pursue
this path I have started on to become proficient in programming. Also met another guy off twitter who is
doing the course which should make it more enjoyable to share the journey with.

## Day 67: 14.06.2018

### Progress: Attended my first meetup and met some interesting people

Attending my first meetup with the Perth Machine Learning Group. It was a bit nerve wracking especially
at the end having to give a brief summary of our groups conversation but it was enjoyable and now I feel
I must also begin the fast.ai journey... another thing to add to the list!

## Day 68: 15.06.2018

### Progress: About half way through the final Advanced CSS Project

I'm starting the understand the difference between CSS Grid and Flexbox and I am getting to like Grid more
then I did initially. Hopefully I can get the entire course finished tomorrow which will allow me to move onto 
CS50 and fast.ai. I have also organised a FCC local meetup which I'm really looking forward. I'm feeling less anxious
about this one compared to the one on Thursday since I organised it.

## Day 69: 16.06.2018

### Progress: Part organised and went to my first FCC Meetup

Went to a two hour meetup with a group of other local coders doing the FCC curriculum. I have wrote enough about it 
on their forums and the Perth FreeCodeCamp forum I won't go into much detail here. It was definately worthwhile and 
will be doing it again next month.

## Day 70: 17.06.2018

### Progress: Busted my ass on Credit.C for CS50

I have a lot to learn and practice in C and writing programs in general it isn't easy. I managed to get it complete but 
not without assistance....again. Retraining my brain to thinking in code is not going to happen overnight!

### Progress: Almost finished off the Advanced CSS Course

Another hour or so and i'll be done with the course. It's been a terrific learning experience but I still have a long
way to go to master modern front end web design CSS, Flex and Grid. Will host the final project and link tomorrow 
night.

### Progress: Finished the Advanced CSS Course Yay!

Finished the course tonight and made some slight modifications of my own to the site as I did like how 
Jonas used Grid in the footer so I switched it to flex.

### Progress: Caught up on some Edx courses i'm enrolled in and watched a CS50 lecture

Taking a break from Udemy Courses to focus on some Edx courses I put on hold and want to catch up on.
Currently have two intro CS courses, an advanced CSS course and how to do simple code. Should take me a 
few months to get them all done. I'm hoping to get the first couple of FCC certificates during that time as 
well.

## Day 74: 21.06.2018

### Progress: 12-13 hour shift at work. Got home at 10:30pm so just prioritised an hour of revision

Very long day so made sure to prioritise my hour on revision and watching some lectures in preparation for my CS50
pset Crack that I want to tackle this weekend.

## Day 75: 22.06.2018

### Progress: crack.c is a pain in the ass. Spent the whole just struggling through the syntax.

I am making very slow progress on the crack.c exercise. I struggle the most with the C syntax as I
find the documentation very hard to read and understand. 

## Day 76: 23.06.2018

### Progress: Finished Crack.c last night and got it submitted for full marks yipee

Once I figured out some of the C syntax bugs I was having the rest of the problem was relatively
straight forward. The algo was definately not as efficient as I am sure it could be but it did the trick
for up to 5 elements. It would definately become unmanigable if numbers, symbols or more digits came into
play.

## Day 77: 24.06.2018

### Progress: Finished a small edX Course of called Advanced CSS Concepts

Had a busy day with the family and did not feel like getting stuck into the music pset on a Sunday
arvo. Had a small CSS course that needed finishing before it expired so I gave that a crack and achieved
the required pass rate to finish the course. I was quite dissappointed with this course and thought the 
previous Udemy Course was leagues ahead of it so I just skimmed through it and did not give it too 
much of my time.
