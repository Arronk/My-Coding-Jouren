## Day 6: 15.04.2018

### Progress: I completed section 12-14 on Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp (Udemy)

Coding was mostly focussed on DOM Manipulation and I would have appreciated more worked exercises as it was definitely all new to me and the syntax will take some time to understand and save to memory.

## Day 7: 16.04.2018

### Progress: Learned how to use Git / Cloud 9 / Github and cloned the 100DaysofCode Repo 

This was rather painful but after a bit of trial and error and some tutorials I picked up the basic git process via the Cloud 9 IDE. Git status, add ., reset .,commit & push. I would probably like to review a bit more about Git now that I understand the basic premise around how it works so that I am better prepared when it comes to working in a team environment. 
I cloned the repo as my commits were not counting to my contributions graph when working with the forked version of the 100DaysofCode Repo.

## Day 8: 17.04.2018

### Progress: Completed Section 15 on Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp (Udemy)

Spent several hours following the code along to the Color Guessing Game Project. I did pause the videos in areas to build sections of the project I had a handle on before Colt showed the solution. I think I would have still struggled to build this entirely on my own, especially in a couple of hours. The project did give me a good oppurtunity to further 
understand and utilise the recent teachings in DOM manipulation which had gone a little over my head. JQuery next!

## Day 9: 18.04.2018

### Progress: Completed Section 16 Into to JQuery   

Read a couple of intersting articles on Medium and watched an episode of the Coding Train on Youtube. The guy makes building a neural network 
so easy, I hope I get to that level of proficiency eventually. The JQuery module was a bit of a let down, only one very basic exercise and lots of video content.
Colt presents the information well and i'm glad he spent more time on vanilla js DOM manipulation first. FCC does it the other way around and I found it easier to put 
context around JQuery's use this time around due the order in which the content was delivered.
