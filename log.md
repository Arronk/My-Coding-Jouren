## Day 6: 15.04.2018

### Progress: I completed section 12-14 on Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp (Udemy)

Coding was mostly focussed on DOM Manipulation and I would have appreciated more worked exercises as it was definitely all new to me and the syntax will take some time to understand and save to memory.

## Day 7: 16.04.2018

### Progress: Learned how to use Git / Cloud 9 / Github and cloned the 100DaysofCode Repo 

This was rather painful but after a bit of trial and error and some tutorials I picked up the basic git process via the Cloud 9 IDE. Git status, add ., reset .,commit & push. I would probably like to review a bit more about Git now that I understand the basic premise around how it works so that I am better prepared when it comes to working in a team environment. 
I cloned the repo as my commits were not counting to my contributions graph when working with the forked version of the 100DaysofCode Repo.

## Day 8: 17.04.2018

### Progress: Completed Section 15 on Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp (Udemy)

Spent several hours following the code along to the Color Guessing Game Project. I did pause the videos in areas to build sections of the project I had a handle on before Colt showed the solution. I think I would have still struggled to build this entirely on my own, especially in a couple of hours. The project did give me a good oppurtunity to further 
understand and utilise the recent teachings in DOM manipulation which had gone a little over my head. JQuery next!

## Day 9: 18.04.2018

### Progress: Completed Section 16 Into to JQuery   

Read a couple of intersting articles on Medium and watched an episode of the Coding Train on Youtube. The guy makes building a neural network look
so easy, I hope I get to that level of proficiency eventually. The JQuery module was a bit of a let down, only one very basic exercise and lots of video content.
Colt presents the information well and i'm glad he spent more time on vanilla JS DOM manipulation first. FCC does it the other way around and I found it easier to put 
context around JQuery's use this time around due to the order in which the content was delivered.

## Day 10: 19.04.2018

### Progress: Completed Section 17-18 Advanced JQuery and Todo List Project   

Spent most of the day doing the code along to the Todo List Project. Its starting to feel like the entirety of this Udemy course is going to be just code alongs which is not going to be as beneficial to my learning as I first thought. I'm definately still learning a lot and it's great to see 
an experienced Developer like Colt work through a project so I can get used to understanding the process. The JQuery Library seems relatively straight forward and definately simplifies vanilla JS DOM Manipulation. Almost onto the backend part of the course now. Planning to get back into the FCC curriculum
and aim towards finishing the front end certificate. I find FCC throws you in the deep end and expects you to sink or swim which I think I am now ready to take on that challenge.

## Day 11: 20.04.2018

### Progress: Learning Paper.js as part of a new quick project

Had some good fun learning about paper.js and playing around with the examples on their website with my kids. Did not get time to finish the exercise as 
I hit a brickwall trying to figure out how to get correct syntax highlighting in Sublime Text 3 for paperscript. After well over an hour of troubleshooting I gave
up and will just resort to using a different text editor like Notepad++ or VS Code when using paperscript in future.

## Day 12: 21.04.2018

### Progress: The project did not turn out to be so quick!

Spent a good amount of time hitting my head against a brick wall trying to read through docs and have the canvas display a 10  x 10 purple grid of circles using paperJS. I managed to get it working but on looking at the solution video was disappointed with how simple the solution was.

## Day 13: 22.04.2018

### Progress: Finished off the Project and loaded it onto Codepen

Finished the paperJS project and loaded it up to codepen. Had a lot of issue trying to figure out how to get sound files hosting and working on codepen but I got there in the end. Also had a bit of a hard time figuring out how to have the document running on localhost to get rid of the error messages.
I managed to get that one sorted as well once I realised something was not enabled. Back end part of the course starts next which I'm really looking forward too.
