# 100 Days of Code - Log

## Day 6: 14.04.2018

### Progress: I completed section 12-14 on Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp (Udemy)

Coding was mostly focussed on DOM Manipulation and I would have appreciated more worked exercises as it was definitely all new to me and the syntax will take some time to understand and save to memory.
